                        <p>Indefinable anguish and hopelessness drove these individuals to attempt taking their own
                            lives. But destiny had something else in store for them.
                            <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">The day they tried killing
                                themselves, they also found themselves. They had collapsed only to rise and take on the
                                world with a newfound sense of personal strength. In their darkest moment, they saw the
                                light of faith, and found out who they really were. Their stories of courage remind us
                                of
                                famous Scottish theologian William Barclay’s words: There are two great days in a
                                person’s
                                life — the day we are born and the day we discover why. On World Suicide Prevention Day,
                                these suicide survivors tell us how their failure turned around their lives forever.
                                Today,
                                they inspire others to live a meaningful life. Here are their stories as told by them.

                        <p>Sitting on the floor in a dimly lit room, I was lost in thought. I had secluded myself from
                            the world. <span id="dots2">...</span> <span id="more2">
                                Negativity had blinded my mind. I had no desire, hope or ambition in life. I felt
                                lost in a maze. I had suffered endlessly in my life because of rejection, bullying and
                                betrayal. I was suffering from depression and bipolar disorder. I felt the only way to
                                feel
                                free was to give up my life. I entered my mom’s room, hugged her tight, told her I was
                                going
                                to rest and swallowed a lot of sleeping pills. I was rushed to the hospital and brought
                                back
                                to life. Initially I was angry with my family for saving me. But the moment of truth
                                came
                                soon. The realisation hit me that I if I was alive even after trying to kill myself, I
                                was
                                alive for a reason. I decided to put the pieces together and start afresh. Therapy and
                                meditation helped me discover my biggest strength in my deepest sorrows. It didn’t
                                happen
                                overnight. It took me four years to understand my inner self. I slowly started erasing
                                all
                                the bad memories. I realised that I was very, very strong. It bought a lot of solace and
                                happiness. Today, I feel content and happy in my life and career. I am grateful to my
                                fans
                                for their love and support. I respect the gift of life. My message to those who like

                        <h3>Reshma Qureshi, acid attack survivor</h3>
                        <p>I was attacked with acid by my estranged brother-in-law when I was 17. He threw concentrated
                            acid on my face in the street. <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">
                                We were in our village in Mau Aima, Uttar Pradesh. I had forgotten my burkha back home
                                in Mumbai so I borrowed my sister’s. My brother-in-law mistook
                                me for his wife. I felt the most excruciating pain and lost eyesight in my left eye as a
                                result of the attack. I was in hospital for months. I was the unintended victim of an
                                attack
                                that wasn’t even meant for me. My face was so badly injured, that my family didn’t allow
                                me
                                to look in the mirror. All the mirrors in the hospitals were covered. When we came home
                                for
                                the first time, I went to wash my face in the kitchen. I looked at myself in the mirror
                                and
                                couldn’t recognise myself. That night, I tried to hang myself with the dupatta. My
                                brother
                                Aizaz woke up when he realised I was shuffling around at night. My family lives in a one
                                bedroom chawl in Mumbai and everyone sleeps in the same room. Aizaz turned on the lights
                                and
                                saw me standing on the bed with a dupatta, aiming to reach the fan. He put two and two
                                together and screamed. Everyone woke up and panicked. There were tears, consolation and
                                love. My family told me how much they loved me and comforted me back to sleep. They
                                motivated me to see therapists and kept telling me that I had to live to see justice.
                                The
                                thought of putting my attacker behind bars kept me going strong. I could not die at the
                                hands of my attacker. He may have taken my face, but my life is mine and mine alone and
                                I
                                just had to be reminded of that fact. I saw many acid attack survivors at the NGO Make
                                Love
                                Not Scars. They were in so much pain for no mistake of their own. They were the victims
                                of
                                someone’s misplaced rage. My heart went out to them and I decided to devote my life to
                                bring
                                a smile on their faces. Today, I work with this NGO and help other acid attack survivors
                                overcome depression. If you want help, do reach out to me. Just don’t kill yourself. The
                                sun
                                does shine again. If we don’t have sadness in life, how will we ever appreciate
                                happiness?
                                It’s a cycle. We have to accept and embrace that. Keep moving on. One step at a
                                time.</span>

                                She was dressed in a blue shalwar-kameez and the sunlight
                                lit up her innocent face. I was astounded by her and realised what love at first sight
                                meant…We got talking and soon became inseparable. But we didn’t know that our love was
                                not
                                going to be easy. Priya is a Brahmin from a village near Hisar, Haryana while I am a

                                Her family was enraged when they got to know about our relationship and we were forced
                                to
                                run away to Delhi. Love Commandos, a vigilante group that supports inter-caste and
                                inter-religious marriages got us wed. We were so happy together. We thought that the
                                worse
                                was over but it was only the beginning of our nightmare. We were conned by her family.
                                They
                                destroyed our world. They got in touch with her and told her that they were ready to
                                accept
                                us. She went to meet them last October and never returned. I got to know that they were
                                trying to remarry her forcibly. I could not bear the separation and tried to kill myself
                                by
                                hanging. My mother saved me, and I can’t thank her enough for that. I returned to the
                                Love
                                Commandos shelter. I can’t leave Priya alone. I will fight for her till the end and get
                                her
                                back. I will make sure that we live to get justice, whatever it takes. I am a volunteer
                                with
                                the NGO now and work to unite lovers. I know that Priya will return one day, and we will
                                grow old together. Love is invincible..</span>
